. Characters such as Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, Daredevil and Doctor Strange are based in New York City,[1][2] whereas the X-Men have historically been based in Salem Center, New York[3][4][5] and Hulk's stories often have been set in the American Southwest[6]
Martin Goodman founded the company later known as Marvel Comics under the name Timely Publications in 1939[7][8]
. Launching his new line from his existing company's offices at 330 West 42nd Street, New York City, he officially held the titles of editor, managing editor, and business manager, with Abraham Goodman officially listed as publisher[8]
. 1939), included the first appearance of Carl Burgos' android superhero the Human Torch, and the first appearances of Bill Everett's anti-hero Namor the Sub-Mariner,[9] among other features[7]
. The issue was a great success, with it and a second printing the following month selling, combined, nearly 900,000 copies[10]
,[7] Timely had its own staff in place by the following year
. The company's first true editor, writer-artist Joe Simon, teamed with artist and emerging industry notable Jack Kirby to create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes,[11] Captain America, in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941)
. It, too, proved a hit, with sales of nearly one million[10]
, beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941[12][13]
. Timely also published one of humor cartoonist Basil Wolverton's best-known features, "Powerhouse Pepper",[14][15] as well as a line of children's funny-animal comics featuring popular characters like Super Rabbit and the duo Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal
Goodman hired his wife's cousin,[16] Stanley Lieber, as a general office assistant in 1939[17]
. When editor Simon left the company in late 1941,[18] Goodman made Lieber—by then writing pseudonymously as "Stan Lee"—interim editor of the comics line, a position Lee kept for decades except for three years during his military service in World War II
Goodman's business strategy involved having his various magazines and comic books published by a number of corporations all operating out of the same office and with the same staff[13]
. As well, some comics' covers, such as All Surprise Comics #12 (Winter 1946–47), were labeled "A Marvel Magazine" many years before Goodman would formally adopt the name in 1961[19]
The post-war American comic market saw superheroes falling out of fashion[20]
Goodman began using the globe logo of the Atlas News Company, the newsstand-distribution company he owned,[21] on comics cover-dated November 1951 even though another company, Kable News, continued to distribute his comics through the August 1952 issues[22]
. This globe branding united a line put out by the same publisher, staff and freelancers through 59 shell companies, from Animirth Comics to Zenith Publications[23]
Atlas, rather than innovate, took a proven route of following popular trends in television and movies—Westerns and war dramas prevailing for a time, drive-in movie monsters another time—and even other comic books, particularly the EC horror line[24]
. Atlas did not achieve any breakout hits and, according to Stan Lee, Atlas survived chiefly because it produced work quickly, cheaply, and at a passable quality[25]
. The stamp on the cover showed audiences that the comics were considered wholesome, entertaining, and educational[26][27]
The first modern comic books under the Marvel Comics brand were the science-fiction anthology Journey into Mystery #69 and the teen-humor title Patsy Walker #95 (both cover dated June 1961), which each displayed an "MC" box on its cover[28]
. 1961),[29] broke convention with other comic book archetypes of the time by squabbling, holding grudges both deep and petty, and eschewing anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status
. Subsequently, Marvel comics developed a reputation for focusing on characterization and adult issues to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them, a quality which the new generation of older readers appreciated[30]
Lee and freelance artist and eventual co-plotter Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four originated in a Cold War culture that led their creators to revise the superhero conventions of previous eras to better reflect the psychological spirit of their age[31]
. Eschewing such comic-book tropes as secret identities and even costumes at first, having a monster as one of the heroes, and having its characters bicker and complain in what was later called a "superheroes in the real world" approach, the series represented a change that proved to be a great success[32]
. Superman rarely crossed national borders or involved himself in political disputes[33]
. Communist agents attack Ant-Man in his laboratory, red henchmen jump the Fantastic Four on the moon, and Viet Cong guerrillas take potshots at Iron Man[34]
. Kennedy and Bob Dylan[35]
. It was Kirby's artwork with its tension and psychedelia that made it perfect for the times—or was it Lee's bravado and melodrama, which was somehow insecure and brash at the same time?"[36]
Marvel even lampooned itself and other comics companies in a parody comic, Not Brand Echh (a play on Marvel's dubbing of other companies as "Brand Echh", à la the then-common phrase "Brand X")[37]
In 1968, while selling 50 million comic books a year, company founder Goodman revised the constraining distribution arrangement with Independent News he had reached under duress during the Atlas years, allowing him now to release as many titles as demand warranted[21]
. Late that year he sold Marvel Comics and his other publishing businesses to the Perfect Film and Chemical Corporation, which continued to group them as the subsidiary Magazine Management Company, with Goodman remaining as publisher[38]
. In 1969, Goodman finally ended his distribution deal with Independent by signing with Curtis Circulation Company[21]
. The market reacted well to the storyline, and the CCA subsequently revised the Code the same year[39]
Goodman retired as publisher in 1972 and installed his son, Chip, as publisher,[40] Shortly thereafter, Lee succeeded him as publisher and also became Marvel's president[40] for a brief time[41]
. During his time as president, he appointed as editor-in-chief Roy Thomas, who added "Stan Lee Presents" to the opening page of each comic book[40]
. Marvel pulled ahead of rival DC Comics in 1972, during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux[42]
. DC followed suit, but Marvel the following month dropped its comics to 20 cents for 36 pages, offering a lower-priced product with a higher distributor discount[43]
Goodman, now disconnected from Marvel, set up a new company called Seaboard Periodicals in 1974, reviving Marvel's old Atlas name for a new Atlas Comics line, but this lasted only a year and a half[44]
. At the 1975 event, Stan Lee used a Fantastic Four panel discussion to announce that Jack Kirby, the artist co-creator of most of Marvel's signature characters, was returning to Marvel after having left in 1970 to work for rival DC Comics[45]
. Captain Britain debuted exclusively in the UK, and later appeared in American comics[46]
. Cover art by Mike Zeck[47]
. During Shooter's nine-year tenure as editor-in-chief, Chris Claremont and John Byrne's run on the Uncanny X-Men and Frank Miller's run on Daredevil became critical and commercial successes[48]
. Shooter brought Marvel into the rapidly evolving direct market,[49] institutionalized creator royalties, starting with the Epic Comics imprint for creator-owned material in 1982; introduced company-wide crossover story arcs with Contest of Champions and Secret Wars; and in 1986 launched the ultimately unsuccessful New Universe line to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Marvel Comics imprint
. DC scored critical and sales victories[50] with titles and limited series such as Watchmen, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Crisis on Infinite Earths, Byrne's revamp of Superman, and Alan Moore's Swamp Thing
. Following the rapid rise of this stock, Perelman issued a series of junk bonds that he used to acquire other entertainment companies, secured by MEG stock[51]
) and the creatively daring though commercially unsuccessful Razorline imprint of superhero comics created by novelist and filmmaker Clive Barker[52][53]
Marvel suffered a blow in early 1992, when seven of its most prized artists — Todd McFarlane (known for his work on Spider-Man), Jim Lee (X-Men), Rob Liefeld (X-Force), Marc Silvestri (Wolverine), Erik Larsen (The Amazing Spider-Man), Jim Valentino (Guardians of the Galaxy), and Whilce Portacio — left to form Image Comics[54] in a deal brokered by Malibu Comics' owner Scott Mitchell Rosenberg[55]
. Three years later Rosenberg sold Malibu to Marvel on November 3, 1994,[55][56][57][58][58][59][60] who acquired the then-leading standard for computer coloring of comic books (developed by Rosenberg) in the process,[61] but also integrating the Genesis Universe (Earth-1136) and the Ultraverse (Earth-93060) into Marvel's multiverse
In late 1994, Marvel acquired the comic book distributor Heroes World Distribution to use as its own exclusive distributor[62]
. As the industry's other major publishers made exclusive distribution deals with other companies, the ripple effect resulted in the survival of only one other major distributor in North America, Diamond Comic Distributors Inc[63][64]
. Then, by the middle of the decade, the industry had slumped, and in December 1996 MEG filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection[51]
. In early 1997, when Marvel's Heroes World endeavor failed, Diamond also forged an exclusive deal with Marvel[65]—giving the company its own section of its comics catalog Previews[66]
. The relaunched titles, which saw the characters transported to a parallel universe with a history distinct from the mainstream Marvel Universe, were a solid success amidst a generally struggling industry,[67] but Marvel discontinued the experiment after a one-year run and returned the characters to the Marvel Universe proper
In 1997, Toy Biz and MEG merged to end the bankruptcy, forming a new corporation, Marvel Enterprises[51]
. With his business partner Avi Arad, publisher Bill Jemas, and editor-in-chief Bob Harras, Toy Biz co-owner Isaac Perlmutter helped stabilize the comics line[68]
. The imprint was helmed by soon-to-become editor-in-chief Joe Quesada; it featured tough, gritty stories showcasing such characters as the Daredevil,[69] Inhumans and Black Panther
Some of its characters have been turned into successful film franchises, such as the Men in Black movie series, starting in 1997, Blade movie series, starting in 1998, X-Men movie series, starting in 2000, and the highest grossing series Spider-Man, beginning in 2002[70]
In a cross-promotion, the November 1, 2006, episode of the CBS soap opera The Guiding Light, titled "She's a Marvel", featured the character Harley Davidson Cooper (played by Beth Ehlers) as a superheroine named the Guiding Light[71]
. The character's story continued in an eight-page backup feature, "A New Light", that appeared in several Marvel titles published November 1 and 8[72]
. Also that year, Marvel created a wiki on its Web site[73]
In late 2007 the company launched Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited, a digital archive of over 2,500 back issues available for viewing, for a monthly or annual subscription fee[74]
In 2009 Marvel Comics closed its Open Submissions Policy, in which the company had accepted unsolicited samples from aspiring comic book artists, saying the time-consuming review process had produced no suitably professional work[75]
